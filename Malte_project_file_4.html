            Not all classrooms have four walls - and not all college experiences need to be at a college!

There are many different ways you can spend a gap year - there is no formula, and YOU are in charge of your year. A gap year can include many different elements, from working, interning, volunteering and studying abroad. 
<ul>
    <li> For earning money, you can stay local or find a job outside your hometown-
         there are many options, which this website page will not focus on. 
         Specifically, this page will provide you with information on studying 
         abroad and taking a gap year. 
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    Taking a gap year or traveling during college is an academic endeavor that can add perspective,
    challenge, and insight into any area of study. There are many programs out there to structure and
    guide your journeys, so that you can make the very most out of your time abroad. Whether you are 
    interested in language, religion, politics, or environmentalism; there is a program out there for
    you! I encourage you to think big and chase your dreams‚ù§
